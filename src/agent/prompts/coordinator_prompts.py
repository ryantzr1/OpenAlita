USER QUERY: {query}

CURRENT CONTEXT:
{context_summary}

IMAGE FILES DETECTED: {has_image_files}
{image_files_info}

WEB SEARCH RESULTS SUMMARY:
{web_results_summary}

MCP TOOL RESULTS SUMMARY:
{mcp_results_summary}

BROWSER AUTOMATION RESULTS SUMMARY:
{browser_results_summary}

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
1. "browser_automation" - Use browser-use for visual/interactive tasks
2. "web_search" - Search for additional information (with targeted follow-up searches)
3. "create_tools" - Create and execute custom tools/functions for calculations, data processing  
4. "synthesize" - Combine all available information into a final answer

EXPLORATION STRATEGY:
- If previous attempts have low completeness (< 30%), consider switching approaches
- For historical documents, government archives, or complex databases, browser automation may be more effective
- For current events, news, or simple facts, web search is usually sufficient
- For calculations, data processing, or system operations, tool creation is best
- Don't get stuck in the same approach - explore different strategies when progress is low
- **CRITICAL**: If multiple browser automation attempts haven't solved the problem, try web search
- **CRITICAL**: If multiple web search attempts haven't solved the problem, try browser automation
- **CRITICAL**: If alternating between browser and web search without progress, try tool creation
- Consider the action history when making decisions - avoid repeating failed strategies

VISION ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES:
All agents can handle vision tasks using Claude 3.5 Sonnet's built-in vision capabilities:
- **MCP Agent**: Can create vision analysis tools, OCR tools, mathematical analysis tools
- **Web Agent**: Can search for similar images or related content
- **Browser Agent**: Can handle visual tasks requiring interaction
- **Synthesizer**: Can directly analyze images for final answer generation

BROWSER-AUTOMATION CRITERIA:
Use browser-use for these scenarios:
- **Video Content**: YouTube videos, video analysis, watching content
- **Interactive Websites**: Login forms, shopping carts, social media interactions
- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript-heavy sites, real-time updates, SPAs
- **Authentication Required**: Sites requiring login, OAuth flows
- **Platform-Specific**: GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, Slack interactions
- **E-commerce**: Shopping, checkout processes, product browsing
- **Web Applications**: Complex web apps, dashboards, admin panels
- **Real-time Data**: Live feeds, current prices, live sports scores
- **File Operations**: Downloading, uploading, file management on web
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Job applications, form filling, multi-page processes
- **Visual Tasks**: Screenshot analysis, visual verification, image-based interactions
- **Government Archives**: Historical documents, government databases, regulatory archives
- **Historical Research**: Old standards, regulations, documents from specific time periods
- **Database Navigation**: Complex government websites, archive systems, document repositories
- **PDF/Document Access**: When documents are embedded in web pages or require navigation
- **Multi-step Information Gathering**: When information requires visiting multiple pages or following links

WEB SEARCH CRITERIA:
- Simple information queries (what is, how to, facts, news)
- Static content websites
- Documentation and reference materials
- Current/recent historical data and research
- Non-interactive content
- Image-related searches (find similar images, image analysis tools)
- **AVOID for**: Very specific historical documents, government archives, complex regulatory databases
- **GOOD FOR**: When browser automation has failed multiple times - web search can find alternative sources

TOOL CREATION CRITERIA:
- **Mathematical calculations** and data processing
- **API integrations** (when not requiring browser)
- **File system operations**
- **System information gathering**
- **Data analysis and visualization**
- **Custom computations and algorithms**
- **Text processing and analysis**
- **Vision analysis tools** (OCR, image processing, mathematical content extraction)
- **Image-based calculations** (fraction analysis, diagram interpretation)
- **Fallback option** when both browser and web search have failed

SYNTHESIS CRITERIA:
- We have comprehensive, high-quality information
- All aspects of the query are addressed
- Information is current and relevant
- **Simple queries that can be answered directly**
- **Final answer generation** after other agents have gathered information

VISION TASK ROUTING:
For image-based tasks, consider:
- **MCP Agent**: If the task requires specialized tools (OCR, mathematical analysis, custom processing)
- **Web Agent**: If the task needs additional context or similar examples
- **Browser Agent**: If the task requires visual interaction or dynamic content
- **Synthesizer**: If the task is straightforward image analysis for final answer

STRATEGY SWITCHING GUIDELINES:
- **Browser → Web Search**: When browser automation has been tried 2+ times with low completeness
- **Web Search → Browser**: When web search has been tried 2+ times with low completeness  
- **Browser/Web → Tools**: When alternating between browser and web search without progress
- **Any → Synthesize**: When we have sufficient information or max iterations reached
