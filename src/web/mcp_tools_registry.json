Uses a fixed radius of 10 as specified\n2. Calculates the area using the standard formula \u03c0r\u00b2\n3. Rounds the result to 2 decimal places for readability\n4. Returns a clear, formatted string with the result\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nresult = calculate_the_area()\n# Output: \"The area of a circle with radius 10 is 314.16 square units\"\n```\n\nThe function is simple, focused, and performs exactly one task: calculating the area of a circle with radius 10.",

Uses the free ipify API service to fetch the public IP\n2. Makes a simple GET request to the API\n3. Returns the IP address in a clear, readable format\n4. Includes proper error handling\n5. Requires only the `requests` module\n6. Performs a single, focused task\n\nTo use it:\n```python\n# Example usage\nresult = get_ip_address(\"what is my current ip address?\")\nprint(result)\n# Output: \"Your current public IP address is: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX\"\n```\n\nNote: The `requests` module needs to be installed using:\n```bash\npip install requests\n```",
